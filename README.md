This is a project to port over this mod to 1.21+ this is meant for the players of MinecraftOnline to be able to use elytras when the server updates or the people that play on 1.21+


# ORIGNAL DESCRIPTION
This mod fixes: Elytra Deployment & Elytra Landing, so that they work better even with server lag and such. Every client modpack should have it.

** This mod requires at least Forge version 2860, and is currently only for MC Java Edition 1.12.2

Tired of your Elytra becoming a deathtrap when the server gets a little laggy?

This is the classic and essential Elytra Fix Module from MASA's Tweakeroo mod made into a Stand-alone Forge mod for Minecraft 1.12.2.

Unfortunately a lot of servers do not allow the Tweakeroo mod to be used because of some of its other features.
This stand-alone Elytra-Fix mod will allow server owners and players to have this essential fix without any of the controversy that comes with Tweakeroo's other features.

This mod retains the license used by Tweakeroo; LGPL 3.0.
